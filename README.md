# What is it?

RPG Tracker is a simple tracking tool to note the last game played with friends and allow them to catch up on the notes. Since it's pretty much logging the entries of the game and what took place, the field for the user will contain a summary and a few dedicated lines of each player involved.

The core idea from this tool would be to share the quick notes of the previous game session quickly to get back started into a new game. Each entry would not need any editing or special features, since it's just adding new information and then the links or the landing page is shared with the users to view.

# How does it work?

The entry for the users will ask for a summary text of the event, and the list of users who were part of the event, including their characters. Any other details could be added later in the development of the application.

# Challenges

There are some challenges in using Django, while this is slightly more complex than Flask, it does offer better support and more documentation. Deploying this app will most likely be done through a Docker container to reduce the need for any special setup or changes.

# Extra goals

Since the app will be shared on the Internet, there's so planned security that will stop malicious users.

# To-do

Area will be updated with tasks to complete.
